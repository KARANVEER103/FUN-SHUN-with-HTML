Write HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit
Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

However, for learning HTML I recommend a simple text editor like (Sublime text 3).

I believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

we can save thr HTML files using   .html    extension.
